üõçÔ∏è Tech Equipment Store - Inventory and Ordering System

This project is a Python-based inventory management and ordering system for a tech equipment store (like ‚ÄúBest Buy‚Äù). The application allows users to list available products, check stock levels, and place orders for multiple products at once.

üöÄ Features

	‚Ä¢	Product Management: Each product is represented by the Product class, which tracks the name, price, available quantity, and whether the product is active.
	‚Ä¢	Store Management: The Store class manages a collection of products, providing functionality to:
	‚Ä¢	Add and remove products from inventory
	‚Ä¢	Display all active products in stock
	‚Ä¢	Process customer orders and update stock levels
	‚Ä¢	User Interface: The command-line interface allows users to:
	1.	List all products available in the store
	2.	Show the total amount of all products in the store
	3.	Make an order by selecting products and quantities
	4.	Exit the program
